          Charles Babbage is often called the "father of the computer." He designed the first automatic mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine, in the 1830s. Although never completed in his lifetime, Babbage's designs contained many features of modern computers, including a control unit and memory.

        <div class="info-text">
          Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, recognized as the first computer programmer. She wrote the first algorithm intended for Babbage's Analytical Engine and foresaw the potential of computers to go beyond mere calculation, imagining their use for music and art.

          Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst. He developed the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model for computation, and played a crucial role in breaking the Enigma code during World War II. Turing is widely regarded as a founding figure in computer science and artificial intelligence.
