           The stored-program concept: John von Neumann's concept fundamentally changed computing by proposing that a computer's instructions and data be stored in the same electronic memory. This made computers flexible, general-purpose machines that could be reprogrammed with new software rather than physically rewired for each task, establishing the foundational architecture for nearly all modern computers.

           The invention of the transistor: The invention of the transistor at Bell Labs was a pivotal engineering breakthrough that replaced the large, fragile, and power-hungry vacuum tubes used in early computers with a smaller, more reliable, and more energy-efficient semiconductor. This innovation made it possible to miniaturize and mass-produce electronic devices, paving the way for integrated circuits and the personal computers of the future.

            ENIAC: Two professors at the University of Pennsylvania, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, design and build the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC). The machine is the first "automatic, general-purpose, electronic, decimal, digital computer," according to Edwin D. Reilly's book "Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology" (Greenwood Press, 2003).

            Integrated circuits become standard: The 1960s saw computers transition from bulky, unreliable vacuum tubes to more compact and efficient solid-state integrated circuits (ICs), or "chips". The Apollo Guidance Computer (1966) was the first to use silicon ICs in a spacecraft, demonstrating their reliability in mission-critical applications.

           ARPANET and packet switching: In 1969, the U.S. Department of Defense launched ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. This network pioneered "packet switching," a novel communication method that broke data into small blocks for transfer and laid the foundation for global computer networking.

          Birth of the UNIX operating system: In 1969, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs began developing UNIX, a powerful and flexible operating system. Its design introduced key concepts like hierarchical file systems and multitasking that continue to influence modern operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

           The rise of the personal computer: The invention of the microprocessor in 1971 made small, affordable computers a reality, leading to the personal computer revolution.
The "1977 Trinity" of home computers (Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80) brought computing into homes and schools for the first time.
The IBM PC, launched in 1981, standardized personal computing for business and ran Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system.
User-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs), popularized by the 1984 Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, made computers accessible to a much broader audience.

          The creation of the World Wide Web: The ARPANET evolved into the internet by adopting the TCP/IP protocol suite in 1983. The invention of the World Wide Web brought it to the masses.
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee at CERN proposed a "universal linked information system" to facilitate automated information sharing.
He then developed the fundamental web technologies: the WorldWideWeb browser, the first web server, HTML, and HTTP.
After CERN made the code publicly available in 1993, the release of user-friendly browsers like Mosaic triggered the Web's rapid popularization.

          The dawn of mobile and social computing: The 2000s were defined by the widespread adoption of the internet and the shift toward mobile and social experiences.
Social networks like Facebook (2004) and Twitter (2006) gained millions of users and popularized "Web 2.0," which emphasized user-generated content and online communities.
The launch of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010 ushered in the era of mobile computing, making computing power accessible in the palm of one's hand and paving the way for the growth of cloud computing services that supported these new applications.

Mobile computing: Fueled by the launch of devices like the iPad in 2010 and the proliferation of powerful smartphones, mobile computing enabled a fundamental shift away from desktop PCs towards ubiquitous, on-the-go internet access. This gave rise to entirely new industries built around mobile platforms, including ride-hailing and streaming, while permanently changing user behavior and communication.
