            The Z3, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1941, is regarded as the world's first programmable digital computer. It utilized 2,600 relays, had a 22-bit word length, and operated at 5â€“10 Hz, with programs stored on punched film. Although developed in Berlin, it was never used operationally and was destroyed in an Allied bombing in December 1943. A replica was made in 1961 and is displayed at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In 1998, it was confirmed to be Turing-complete, despite lacking conditional branching. Zuse is often considered the computer's inventor due to his groundbreaking work.

            ENIAC, Two professors at the University of Pennsylvania, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, design and build the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC). The machine is the first "automatic, general-purpose, electronic, decimal, digital computer," according to Edwin D. Reilly's book "Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology" (Greenwood Press, 2003).

            Integrated circuits become standard: The 1960s saw computers transition from bulky, unreliable vacuum tubes to more compact and efficient solid-state integrated circuits (ICs), or "chips". The Apollo Guidance Computer (1966) was the first to use silicon ICs in a spacecraft, demonstrating their reliability in mission-critical applications.

           ARPANET and packet switching: In 1969, the U.S. Department of Defense launched ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. This network pioneered "packet switching," a novel communication method that broke data into small blocks for transfer and laid the foundation for global computer networking.

          Birth of the UNIX operating system: In 1969, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs began developing UNIX, a powerful and flexible operating system. Its design introduced key concepts like hierarchical file systems and multitasking that continue to influence modern operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

           The rise of the personal computer The invention of the microprocessor in 1971 made small, affordable computers a reality, leading to the personal computer revolution.
The "1977 Trinity" of home computers (Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80) brought computing into homes and schools for the first time.
The IBM PC, launched in 1981, standardized personal computing for business and ran Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system.
User-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs), popularized by the 1984 Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows, made computers accessible to a much broader audience.

          The creation of the World Wide Web The ARPANET evolved into the internet by adopting the TCP/IP protocol suite in 1983. The invention of the World Wide Web brought it to the masses.
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee at CERN proposed a "universal linked information system" to facilitate automated information sharing.
He then developed the fundamental web technologies: the WorldWideWeb browser, the first web server, HTML, and HTTP.
After CERN made the code publicly available in 1993, the release of user-friendly browsers like Mosaic triggered the Web's rapid popularization.

          The dawn of mobile and social computing The 2000s were defined by the widespread adoption of the internet and the shift toward mobile and social experiences.
Social networks like Facebook (2004) and Twitter (2006) gained millions of users and popularized "Web 2.0," which emphasized user-generated content and online communities.
The launch of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010 ushered in the era of mobile computing, making computing power accessible in the palm of one's hand and paving the way for the growth of cloud computing services that supported these new applications.
